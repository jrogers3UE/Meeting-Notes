# Josh & Sara Meeting Notes

## Sep. 4th 2023 (Machine Learning AAV Project and Lung Dissociation Review)

- Grant will not be submitted due to offical staff costings/time commitment to project on top of RA/PhD position, which is planned to be completed within an already rushed 36 month time period. Also, SMG is likely reluctant to process a late concept note. 

- Will determine if project fits remit of Kenny's previously awarded or upcoming grants. Project could be funded this way. 

- I should continue the project regardless of the funding, since producing AAV libraries in house would be relatively cheap. However, this would be time consuming. The only remaining large costs would be bulk and single cell sequencing costs. 

- It would be better to present percentages of cell populations in FC graphs more clearly, and to make one graph which shows number of cells sorted for all four graphs.
