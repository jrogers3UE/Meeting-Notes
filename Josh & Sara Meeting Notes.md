# Josh & Sara Meeting Notes

## Sep. 14th 2023 ()

- I need to communicate better. There have been incidents of perceived impoliteness. 

- [x] Update aims and objectives for AAV project, send to Maraiana. 

- World Courier is preferred shipping company for lab. 

- [ ] Who has the MTA for shipping AAV? Gerry? Who takes ownership? Can I bring it here? Is the AAV proprietary?

- Will plan to have 10-month report turned in before leaving for Oxford, will have meeting when I am back. Preload presentation work. 

- Always get permission from someone to spend money in writing. 

- [x] Send Spring School notes to Sara 

### Questions/Comments

- [x] Ask about ESGCT conference

- [x] ESGCT poster (sc dissociation and ML model)

- [ ] Postpone internal virology seminary talk? 

- [ ] When should I reach out to the committee to officially schedule a meeting? 

- [ ] When should I buy and ship reagents to Oxford? 

- [ ] Which CAV2 guide will I use, can I see the final data?
 		- Benchling has James report. 

- [ ] We have a CMV GFP lenti. What should I use this for?
		- WIll compare this to Gerrt's, it is -80, lentibox three)

- [x] Respond to person asking about Annual Review. Do I upload the new version?

- [x] What could be wrong with GGTA1 transfection experiment? 




## Sep. 5th 2023 (Annual Review, Oxford, GGTA1 KO)

- [x] Rewrite science sections of annual review in objectives/aims/plan format. Use bullet points so it is easy to recogize what has been accomplished next year. 

- There is no need to redo any experiments at this time. 

- I will need to repeat GGTA1 KO experiment with both constructs three times before determining which guide to clone into LV. 

- [ ] Read Beate Rieblinger paper which describes KO of GGTA1 in Cas9 pig. 

- Plan to have 10-week report handed before I leave for Oxford and to schedule the meeting after I get back (just before Christmas holiday or after)

- [ ] What is a potential title for my thesis?




## Sep. 4th 2023 (Machine Learning AAV Project and Lung Dissociation Review)

- Grant will not be submitted due to offical staff costings/time commitment to project on top of RA/PhD position, which is planned to be completed within an already rushed 36 month time period. Also, SMG is likely reluctant to process a late concept note. 

- [ ] Will determine if project fits remit of Kenny's previously awarded or upcoming grants. Project could be funded this way. 

- I should continue the project regardless of the funding, since producing AAV libraries in house would be relatively cheap. However, this would be time consuming. The only remaining large costs would be bulk and single cell sequencing costs. 

- It would be better to present percentages of cell populations in FC graphs more clearly, and to make one graph which shows number of cells sorted for all four graphs. 

- [x] Look into mechanism of CTV.

- Eamon will complete all single cell analyses for now. 

- It could be beneficial to have a structural biologist contributing to the project. It would be useful to know more about the conformation of the VP region, possibly something that could be tested using alphafold. 
	- [ ] How does AAV2H22 conformation look?

- If I do the directed evolution experiment in pig lung, the top performing variants will be biased toward pig lung and not human lung. 

- [ ] The question remains whether I will be able to get human lung for machine learning directed evolution (MLDE AAV experiment). End goal should be able to perform experiments in human lungs.
