Josh's Road Map 

# Purchase List

	- [ ] 500 mL centrifugation tubes? 
	- [ ] 500 mL tube holders? 
	- [ ] Ultracentrifuge tube rack? 
	- [ ] Benzonase
	- [ ] Repcap 
	- [ ] Helper 
	- [ ] Antibody for protein related to gene (WB, FACS, FL)
	- [ ] Primers for guides and sequencing
	- [ ] sgRNAs for gene




# Aim 1: Choose a gene implicated in COVID-19

## Criteria for choosing gene:

	- [ ] SNP is significant
	- [ ] Most exciting (even if the gene is well described, just don't repeat experiments that have already been done)
	- [ ] There is a strong association to the gene. I can't look up the strength of the SNP to the gene in the supplementary graphs in GWAS papers. 
	- [ ] Is it a protein coding gene? 
	- [ ] Is there an ortholog in pigs?
	- [ ] Is it expressed at a high enough level in the lung that a KO could be detected with FL, WB sequencing? Is it difficult to target?
	- [ ] Note reasons that make it a good gene to study (will go in write up)




# Aim 2: Detect GFP in PCLS with Gerry's lenti

## Objectives

	- [ ] Image PCLS transduced with vGM107 with confocal, use lamda imaging
	- [ ] Stain sections with anti-GFP antibody and colocalize
	- [ ] Enquire about their quantification package. Is this what Craig mentioned a long time ago?




# Aim 3: Design sgRNAs and plasmids for COVID gene

## Objectives: 

	- [ ] Buy gene relevant antibody for WB and FL colocalization
	- [ ] Review sgRNA design myself and confirm with Nick
	- [ ] Figure out which primers I will need for plasmids, look through inventory, buy additional primers if needed. 
	- [ ] Design and order at least 3-4 guide RNAs. 
	- [ ] Design new plasmid which contains spCas9 (keep everything else the same).
	- [ ] Megaprep new Cas9 plasmid
	- [ ] Clone guides into Cas9 plasmid




# Aim 4: Assess cutting efficiency of guides in Cas9 plasmid in relevant cell line (should be lung cell type relevant cell line, to account for eu/heterochromatin)

## Objectives: 
	- [ ] Transfect relevant lung cell line with plasmid 
	- [ ] Assess transfection efficiency with FACS, cutting efficiency with sequencing, and protein expression differences with WB (will Agarose interfere with downstream analyses, or will lysates break down agarose?)




# Aim 5: Transduce cell line with NT AAV

## Objectives: 
	- [ ] Transduce cell line(s) in well plate 
	- [ ] Detect GFP with Axio




# Aim 6: Transduce WT PCLS with NT AAV

## Objectives: 
	- [ ] Transduce PCLS with NT AAV 
	- [ ] Assess transduction. Perform spectral unmixing on confocal. Colin wants to see this. Quantify?




# Aim 7: Produce specific rAAV serotype (one validated in pig?) which will target cell-types of interest

## Objectives: 

	- [ ] Research which rAAV serotype will best target cell-types of interest. 
	- [ ] Clone in top performing validated guide to AAV transfer plasmid.  
	- [ ] Produce a rAAV with a NT guide (if I don't already have one for the serotype) Make enough for multiple cell line and PCLS experiments. 




# Aim 8: Transduce relevant cell line and assess KO

## Objectives: 

	- [ ] Pick a cell line which expressess gene of interest 
	- [ ] Transduce cell line with a range of MOIs. Make sure not to test too many, since I will do everything in triplicate and have multiple downstream analyses. 
	- [ ] Assess transduction efficency with FL and FACS. 
	- [ ] Assess knock out efficiency with sequencing. 
	- [ ] Assess protein difference with WB. 




# Write up 	

	- [ ] Write up bits from Oxford.
	- [ ] Write up after guides successfully knockout gene in cell line. 




# Additional Tasks

	- [ ] Come up with the entire project plans, start, middle and end (with contingency plans) for every aim, if not objective.
