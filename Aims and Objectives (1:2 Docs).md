# Josh's Road Map 


# Aim 1: Choose a gene implicated in COVID-19

## Criteria/Questions to answer for choosing gene

	- [ ] SNP is significant
	- [ ] Most exciting 
	- [ ] There is a strong association to the gene. I can look up the strength of the SNP to the gene in the supplementary graphs in GWAS papers. 
	- [ ] Is it a protein coding gene? 
	- [ ] Is there an ortholog in pigs?
	- [ ] Is it expressed at a high enough level in the lung that a KO could be detected with FL, WB sequencing? Is it difficult to target?
	- [ ] Note reasons that make it a good gene to study (will go in write up)


# Aim 2: Detect GFP in PCLS with Gerry's lenti

## Objectives

	- [ ] Image PCLS transduced with vGM107 with confocal, use lamda imaging
	- [ ] Stain sections with anti-GFP antibody 
	- [ ] Enquire about craig's quantification package


# Aim 3: Design sgRNAs and plasmids for COVID gene 

## Objectives: 

	- [ ] Buy gene relevant antibody for WB and fluorescence microscopy
	- [ ] Review sgRNA design myself and confirm with Nick
	- [ ] Figure out which primers I will need for plasmids, look through inventory, buy additional primers if needed 
	- [ ] Design and order at least 4 guide RNAs
	- [ ] Clone guides into plasimd
	- [ ] Maxiprerp plasmids 


# Aim 4: Assess cutting efficiency of plasmids with sgRNAs in Cas9 NSK cell line

## Objectives: 
	- [ ] Transfect Cas9 NSKs with plasmids
	- [ ] Assess transfection efficiency with FACS, cutting efficiency with sequencing, and protein expression differences with WB
	- [ ] Choose best candidate to use for AAV


# Aim 5: Transduce Cas9 NSK with NT AAV to assess transduction efficiency

## Objectives: 
	- [ ] Transduce Cas9 NSKs with NT AAV (use vGM107 as a control)
	- [ ] Assess and compare GFP expression of AAV to LV. 


# Aim 6: Transduce WT PCLS with NT AAV

## Objectives: 
	- [ ] Transduce PCLS with NT AAV (use vGM107 as a control)
	- [ ] Assess transduction. Perform spectral unmixing on confocal. Quantify if GFP is detected.
